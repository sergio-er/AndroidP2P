# EC530 AndroidChatApp
By Sergio Rodriguez sergioer@bu.edu
## Firebase Cloud Messaging
It allows for users to create accouunt and message other users through the app. It uses Firebase as a hosting service. In its current iteration is using cloud based messaging, in the long term I hope to establish P2P connections through the use of WebRTC. If you look at the main branch, you could see the initial intention of setting up the stun servers etc.


## Work Pending
